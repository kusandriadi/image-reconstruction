class JobManager:
    """Asynchronous job queue manager for image reconstruction tasks.

    This class manages the complete lifecycle of reconstruction jobs using background
    worker threads. It provides thread-safe operations for job creation, status tracking,
    progress updates, and cancellation. Each job runs in its own daemon thread.

    Job States:
        - queued: Job is waiting to start
        - running: Job is currently processing
        - completed: Job finished successfully
        - failed: Job encountered an error
        - cancelled: Job was cancelled by user
        - cancelling: Job is in the process of being cancelled

    Attributes:
        reconstructor: The Reconstructor instance used for processing.
        uploads_dir: Directory containing uploaded input images.
        outputs_dir: Directory where reconstructed images are saved.

    Thread Safety:
        All public methods are thread-safe and can be called concurrently from
        multiple threads. Internal state is protected by a threading.Lock.

    Example:
        >>> reconstructor = Reconstructor(model_path="model.pth")
        >>> manager = JobManager(reconstructor, "uploads/", "outputs/")
        >>> manager.enqueue(job_id="abc123", input_path="uploads/abc123_image.png")
        >>> status = manager.get("abc123")
        >>> print(status["progress"])  # 0-100
        >>> manager.cancel("abc123")
