class UploadValidator:
    """Validator for uploaded image files.

    This class validates uploaded images against configurable constraints including
    file size limits, allowed MIME types, and allowed file extensions. It also
    verifies that uploaded files are valid, decodable images and sanitizes filenames
    to prevent security issues.

    Security Features:
        - Filename sanitization removes dangerous characters
        - MIME type validation prevents malicious file uploads
        - Image integrity check ensures files are valid images
        - File size limits prevent DoS attacks

    Attributes:
        allowed_mime: Set of allowed MIME types (e.g., {"image/png", "image/jpeg"}).
        allowed_ext: Set of allowed file extensions (e.g., {".png", ".jpg"}).
        max_bytes: Maximum allowed file size in bytes.
        uploads_dir: Directory where validated files will be saved.

    Example:
        >>> validator = UploadValidator(
        ...     allowed_mime={"image/png", "image/jpeg"},
        ...     allowed_ext={".png", ".jpg"},
        ...     max_bytes=10 * 1024 * 1024,  # 10 MB
        ...     uploads_dir=Path("uploads/")

        >>> upload_path = await validator.save(job_id="abc123", file=uploaded_file)
